# manifolds

This is a repository for solutions to Lee's textbooks on manifolds. In
particular, this arose from group working through Lee's "Introduction to
Smooth Manifolds" which is the primary goal of the repository.

Anyone should feel free to add their own solutions, edit the existing solutions,
add partial solutions. If you don't feel comfortable deleting or editing
someone else's solutions you can add an alternate solution. Alternative
approaches are definitely recommended.

Different levels of proof are fine. If you want to get into the gory details,
feel free. If you want to add a quick sketch, or just add the key parts of
an argument, feel free. The point is to contribute in any way possible and be
of help to others working through the text or learning the subject.

I plan to add the statements of the theorems mentioned in the book, which can
then be easily referenced (using hyperlinks) in proofs of problems (e.g., a
proof of a particular exercise references Theorem 6.7, one can then click on
'Theorem 6.7' and it jumps you to the statement of the theorem.). No proofs of
those statements should be included as they are in the book.

The exercises themselves will have the statement of the exercise as well as the
solution (full detailed proof, sketch, partial solution, hints, etc.)

This project was forked from the [stacks](http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/)
project. I created a stripped down version called
[latex-skeleton](https://github.com/robertcardona/latex-skeleton) to be used
to easily setup an online book, or lecture notes, or some type of
unconventional blog that is really a book in LaTeX form, but can be turned
into a website using the other tools from the stacks project, namely the
[stacks-website](https://github.com/stacks/stacks-website).

Ideally, there will be a website up soon in a similar form as the stacks
project which allows for easy navigation, commenting, reading, etc.
